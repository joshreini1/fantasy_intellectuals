# Fantasy Intellectuals
Operationalizing Arnold Kling's 'Fantasy Intellectuals' to improve thoughtful discourse.

Background information on Fantasy Intellectuals or FITs for short, can be found here:

The purpose of this project is to automate the scoring of FITs using modern natural language processing and machine learning techniques.

Input data will eventually come from blogs, podcasts, books, articles and twitter. I will start with twitter because it is the most tractable to ingest.

The following scoring mechanism is derived from Arnold Kling, stated in his post 'Fantasy Intellectual Teams: version 2.0'

A scoring category should be a quantifiable indicator of the qualities we want in an intellectual. Qualitatively, what we seek to do is reward those who:

–put forth interesting ideas for discussion
–try to persuade someone who might disagree, rather than simply rile up people who already agree
–demonstrate a willingness to face up to the weaknesses of one’s own position and the best points that can be made by someone on the other side
–make careful statements and tests them against evidence

Rotisserie scoring will be used to ensure that each category matters. An owner cannot dominate a league by just picking intellectuals who pile up points in a single category.

Categories for point scoring are as follows:

(S) steel-manning. Undertake an extensive criticism of a point of view in which you attempt to articulate the strongest case for the view against which you are arguing. For example, Scott Alexander’s book review of Freddie deBoer.

(C) caveats. You earn a C for taking a skeptical look at your own point of view, pointing out the weaknesses in it.

(D) discussion-starter. This could be an idea that becomes a topic of discussion. You could put the idea forth in an essay, a blog post, a podcast, a tweet, or a book.

(B) Thinking in bets. To earn a B, a you must make a prediction with odds that could be translated into a bet. “I think that X is more likely to happen than Y” does not count.

(O) open to reconsideration. You earn an O if during the season you change your mind on an issue or say that you are reconsidering a point of view, and explain why. Describing a change of mind that took place prior to the season (“I used to be for the Iraq war, but then I changed my mind”) does not count.

(R) research summary. You must formulate a specific question, such as “By how much does a higher minimum wage reduce employment?” and summarize the best research on either side of the question.

(P) pair-off. You engage in an extended, fair debate with someone on an issue where you strongly disagree.

(L) Lucifer’s advocate. In order to probe another person’s point of view, a player during a podcast or email interview plays Devil’s Advocate. You hear Russ Roberts do this on some of his podcasts, for example.
